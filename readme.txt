Analysis of related chemical fingerprints using eigenvalue-based entropy used a dataset in HMDB (http://www.hmdb.ca/) with the search queires to retrieve metabolite found in blood on Sep 4, 2019.
In the follow-up analysis, the dataset from the Franco et al. was used (https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1758-2946-6-5).

Some of the scripts use parallel (O. Tange (2011): GNU Parallel - The Command-Line Power Tool,;login: The USENIX Magazine, February 2011:42-47.)
